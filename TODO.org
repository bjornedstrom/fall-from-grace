fall-from-grace

* TODO Handle SIGSTOP better
Say we have the rule

stop @ 10m

Then we CONT after 9 minutes and 50 seconds. Then fall-from-grace will
STOP again after 10 seconds. Annoying!

Perhaps have a background thread to keep track of this?

* TODO Child processes
Support having a monitor also check the child processes. Can be
useful.
